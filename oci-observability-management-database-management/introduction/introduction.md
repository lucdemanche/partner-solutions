# Introduction

## About this Workshop

As a database administrators, we manage a fleet of databases composed of Autonomous, Standard and Enterprise Edition databases. Everyone has their own way to monitor the fleet, that includes scripts, tools and utilities.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has a cloud service called "Database Management", an unified console for on-premises and cloud databases with lifecycle database management capabilities for monitoring, performance management, tuning, and administration.
